> _“Every man has two lives, and the second starts when he realizes he has just one.” — Confucius_

What if you could visualize, every day, how much of your life has already passed?

Death is scary. It’s uncomfortable to think about—so we tend to avoid it. But when we use death not as something to fear, but as a **frame of reference**, it becomes a powerful tool for clarity.

Ancient wisdom always teaches us life principles and philosophies. They stood the test of time for a reason. I like the Stoic “live as if today were your last” mindset and _Memento Mori_, a Latin phrase that translates to “remember that you must die.”

Death is the ultimate equalizer. Despite our differences in appearance, cultures, and beliefs, we are all going to die. Death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.

This universal truth inspired me to build a **[Death Clock](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/shared/death-clock/)**. It calculates two metrics:

1. How old I am.
2. What percentage of my life is (probably) behind me.

Every morning, my Lock Screen greets me with these numbers, thanks to a [Personal Automation](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/intro-to-personal-automation-apd690170742/ios).

I used to put off small joys in _this moment, [this pixel](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html), this now_—[calling a loved one](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/lifeos-toolkits/call-people-i-love/), taking a walk, savoring a meal—thinking there would always be more time later. But _later_ often means _never_. [It's later than you think.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFxjnUPRwx4)

The [Death Clock](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/shared/death-clock/) reminds me that every single second I’m dying. It internalizes the certainty of death, rewiring my brain to prioritize what I might [regret on my deathbed](https://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/). **It’s not the number that is the most important, but seeing the number changing day after day that makes the difference.**

> _“Almost everything…just fall[s] away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important…Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking: you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.” — Steve Jobs_ [^1]

Paradoxically, it’s only when death waits at the end of the road that the unique meaning of each person’s life can fully emerge. When you embrace the inescapability of death, you know you have nothing to lose and stop worrying what other people think about you. Life becomes less about proving yourself and more about giving away your gift to something greater than you. You view life as a service.

Mitch Albom once said in _Tuesdays With Morrie_:

> _“The truth is, once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.”_

I believe that _learning how to die_ means being prepared for it—knowing that it’s inevitably coming. Once you accept that death is not the opposite of life, but rather an essential part of it, you begin to notice and appreciate the little small things in your day, welcoming whatever comes your way.

So, live each day as it were your last, because someday you’ll certainly be right. Every time you do something that is one less time you could do it. Cherish every moment of your life like it is your last, because it very likely might be. Every single thing you do today is something your ninety-year-old self will wish they could come back and do. The good old days are happening right now.

Make the rest of your life the best of your life. Don’t live the same year 75 times and call it a life. Don’t be a “Living Dead.” Never _die_ before you are _dead_. One day, your life will flash before your eyes. Make sure it’s worth watching.

In the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.

孔子曾說：「每個人都有兩次生命。第二次生命，始於他認知到生命只有一次那刻。」

死亡令人恐懼，我們本能地逃避思考它。但若將死亡視為生命的「參考座標」，而非恐懼來源，它便成為了釐清人生優先順序的強大工具。

拉丁語 _Memento Mori_（請記住，你終將一死），歷經時間考驗，正是因為它們揭示了這項真理。


死亡是終極的平衡器，無論我們的外貌、文化、信仰有多大差異，死亡是我們共同的終點，無人能倖免。


# 我的最後一天會是什麼樣子？

# [The Ideal End State](https://x.com/camp4/status/1721908863124025492)

1. WHO you’d be around
2. WHAT you’d do with your time
3. WHERE you’d be
4. HOW things would look & feel

On the death bed at my 80s, I want to be able to utter these words: “yeah I was working in this field I didn’t really like and my life was kind of miserable and my output sucked and then I realized I should actually be doing this other thing in this weird niche that no one has ever quite done before but I find myself to be perfectly suited for. Now, I’m great at what I do and am very happy and the world gets to experience one more unique instantiation of greatness than it did yesterday.”

**I want to die…**
* with zero
* in sleep peacefully
* with no regrets

# 死前五大後悔

# [Bronnie Ware's “Top Five Regrets of the Dying”](https://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/)

**What people most often regret before they die (Deathbed Regret):** [^2]

1. I wish I had the courage to live a life true to myself, not trying to a people pleaser and lived the life others expected of me.
2. I wish I didn’t work so hard. [^3]
3. I wish I had the courage to express my feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.

To avoid these mistakes, [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/todo.html) inverted the regrets to five commands:

1. Don’t ignore your dreams
2. Don’t work too much
3. Say what you think
4. Cultivate friendships
5. Be happy

Stop fearing the regret of action and start fearing the regret of inaction. The regret from inaction is always more painful than the regret from action. Nobody gets to their deathbed and says, “I’m sorry for trying so many things.”

Takeaway: [The biggest regrets aren't about _failing_; they're about _not trying at all_.](https://youtu.be/RcYv5x6gZTA) No one ever said: “_I wish I hadn’t tried so many things._” or “_I wish I hadn’t been so adventurous with my life._” on their deathbed. More often than not, people regret the chances they didn’t take, the dreams they set aside, and the experiences they were too afraid to pursue.

Remarks: Through history, people have gone back into their own pasts, sometime to a precious, unstructured time in their life, and often, the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame, some sin of anger/self-pity committed, some act of selfishness, an act of omission/shallowness, a lack of courage.

# 以終為始：反向工程
* Stop chasing things that can be bought and start prioritizing things that must be earned.
* A calm and peaceful mind (Emotional/Spiritual/Mental Freedom)
	* 坦然地接受/納自己的一切，尤其是不完美的部分（Accepting myself, flaw and all.）
		* I am complete in my incompleteness.
		* I am perfect in my imperfectness.
	* 「漂泊的靈魂，安定、平靜的內心」
	* 「安在」與「自在」
	* 「應為當為，超然自得」
		* 專注於自己的責任與本分，不必過度在意外界的評價或干擾。當一個人能堅持做該做的事，內心自然會達到一種超然、自在的境界，這種精神與儒家思想中的「盡本分」以及道家強調的「無為而治」有相似之處。
	* 隨遇而安 —「不如意事常八九，可與人言無二三 [^4]。」
	* 「不以物喜，不以己悲 — 無欲則剛」
		* 出自北宋范仲淹的《岳陽樓記》：不因外物的得失而高興，也不因自己的遭遇好壞而悲傷。這句話展現了一種君子之風，強調內心的淡泊與堅定，不受外在環境的影響。
		* Never let success get into your head. Never let failure get into your heart.
		* _[“If you win, you need not have to explain...If you lose, you should not be there to explain!” — Adolf Hitler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/137599-if-you-win-you-need-not-have-to-explain-if-you)_
* A fit body (Health)
	* Clear pee
	* [Being in shape isn’t something you can “bank” by completing an intensive project and then forget about later. You need to maintain good habits and attitudes to ensure you’re getting enough physical activity by default—even when you’re not “trying to get in shape.”](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2024/07/09/the-twelve-foundations-for-a-good-life/)
* A house full of love (Relationships)
	* Home is not where you were born; home is where all your attempts to escape cease.
	* 家，比房子重要。

# 死亡時鐘

「每天早上，我的手機鎖定畫面都會提醒我兩件事：我今年幾歲，以及我的人生（大概）過去了百分之多少。這不是悲觀的倒數計時，而是我用來校準人生方向的羅盤。」

如果每天睜開眼，你都能清楚看見自己的人生進度條，你會如何度過這一天？
我把它做成了手機桌布，天天提醒自己。



我曾習慣推遲當下的微小喜悅——打電話給心愛的人、散步、品嚐一頓飯——總以為未來還有大把時間。但「以後」常常意謂著「永不」。如同賈伯斯所言：「在死亡面前，幾乎所有的事情…都會消逝，只留下真正重要的。提醒自己你將死去，是我所知避免陷入『害怕失去』思維陷阱的最好方法。你本就赤裸，沒有理由不順從你的內心。」[^1]

弔詭的是，正因為死亡在道路的盡頭等待，每個生命獨特的意義才得以彰顯。當你擁抱死亡的必然，便知自己無所畏懼，不再憂慮他人眼光。生命不再是為了證明自己，而是將天賦奉獻給比自身更宏大的事物。

作家米奇·艾爾邦在《最後 14 堂星期二的課》中寫道：

> 「事實是，一旦你學會如何死亡，你就學會了如何活著。」

學會死亡，意味著為其到來做好準備，接受它並非生命的對立面，而是生命不可或缺的一部分。於是，你開始留意並感激日常的微小事物，坦然迎接生命中的一切。

所以，將每一天當作最後一天來活，因為總有一天你會是對的。你做的每一件事，都可能是你此生能做這件事的倒數計時。好好珍惜每個當下，因為它很可能就是你的最後一刻。你今天所做的每一件平凡小事，都是 90 歲的你渴望能重溫的舊夢。所謂「過去的好時光」，就是現在。

別重複地過一年 75 次，然後稱之為一生。別在「死去」之前，就成為行屍走肉。總有一天，你的一生將在眼前閃回，請確保它值得一看。

因為最終，重要的不是你活了多少歲，而是你的歲月中有多少生命。

學會死亡，就學會活著。
