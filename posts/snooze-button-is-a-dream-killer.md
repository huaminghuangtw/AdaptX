**Quit hitting the snooze button ⏰**

* When you hit snooze, you’re telling your hopes and dreams that they can wait.

> _“Snooze button is a dream killer. When you press the snooze button, you’re killing your dreams. So, don’t touch the snooze button.” — Jocko Willink_

> _[Unsere Träume können wir erst dann verwirklichen, wenn wir uns entschließen, einmal daraus zu erwachen. (當我們決定從夢中醒來時，我們才有可能實現自己的夢想。)](http://www.godic.net/home/dailysentence/c66d4c09-48ca-4fea-8665-779d2476f62c)_

* When you wake up in the morning you have two choices: go back to sleep, or wake up and chase those dreams. [^1]
* Remember why you are doing this: You get only one life, **one that is not rewarded for staying in bed, one that does not move forward because you stole an extra five minutes of your life.**
	* If you want more sleep, you need to get to bed earlier, not wake up later.
	* Going back to sleep for a few minutes actually leaves you more tired/lazier/groggier than waking up immediately. Set your alarm and stick to it.
	* You cannot miss out your magical time in the morning. You cannot miss out the only opportunity to win the morning and the entire day.

* “The Breeze At Dawn” by Rumi

> The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you.
> Don’t go back to sleep.
>
> You must ask for what you really want.
> Don’t go back to sleep.
>
> People are going back and forth across the doorsill
> where the two worlds touch.
>
> The door is round and open.
> Don’t go back to sleep.

* “At Dawn” by Marcus Aurelius

> At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work—as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for— the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?
>
> —But it’s nicer here… .
>
> So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
>
> —But we have to sleep sometime… .
>
> Agreed. But nature set a limit on that—as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you’re still below your quota.
>
> You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they’re really possessed by what they do, they’d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts.
>
> Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?

[^1]: _“The test is not a complex one: when the alarm goes off, do you get up out of bed, or do you lie there in comfort and fall back to sleep? If you have the discipline to get out of bed, you win—you pass the test. If you are mentally weak for that moment and you let that weakness keep you in bed, you fail. Though it seems small, that weakness translates to more significant decisions. But if you exercise discipline, that too translates to more substantial elements of your life.” ― Jocko Willink, Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win_
