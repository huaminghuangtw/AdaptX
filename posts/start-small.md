再也不要因為事情微小而不為。只有不斷重複做小事，才能成就偉大。不要忽略或輕視任何一件小事，要很認真地對待每一件小事。因為一個人做一件小事的態度，就是他/她做每一件事的態度！

Everything above zero compounds positively!

* _“Focus on the basics. Get the basics right. Approximately 95% of your results will come from the basic-level foundation.” — Arnold Schwarzenegger_
* _“It is the greatest of all mistakes to do nothing because you can only do little; do something.” — Sydney Smith_

[Every effort counts.](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/youre-always-building-your-own-house) [How you do one thing is how you do everything.](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/21977839-leaders-eat-last-why-some-teams-pull-together-and-others-don-t) Anything above zero compounds positively. Start with small baby steps. Always [take the small things seriously](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-professional-in-your-work/), because [small things become big things](https://youtu.be/mZPN9W-jPm4).

* Running one mile has more in common with running a marathon than sitting at home.
* Investing $100 has more in common with being a millionaire than being broke.
* Writing one sentence has more in common with writing a book than never writing one.

Every race starts with one step. Every fortune starts with a small deposit. Every book begins as one sentence.
