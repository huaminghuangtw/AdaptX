> _[Unsere Träume können wir erst dann verwirklichen, wenn wir uns entschließen, einmal daraus zu erwachen. (當我們決定從夢中醒來時，我們才有可能實現自己的夢想。)](http://www.godic.net/home/dailysentence/c66d4c09-48ca-4fea-8665-779d2476f62c)_

當我第一次聽到我的「自律」導師之一，也是美國前海軍海豹部隊（Navy SEAL）指揮官 [Jocko Willink](https://www.google.com/search?q=Jocko+Willink) 在 [某次訪談](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dMxPmuXriEs) 中說：[^1]

> _Snooze button is a dream killer. When you press the snooze button, you’re killing your dreams._

我心想：「怎麼辦，我很常按下貪睡鍵耶！難道我是個不配擁有夢想的人嗎？ＱＱ」

他也在《[Extreme Ownership](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010780434)》書中寫道：「當鬧鐘響起時，你是立刻起床，還是 [繼續賴在溫暖的被窩裡](https://sketchplanations.com/snerdle)？如果你有紀律地起床，你就贏了；如果你在那一刻心智軟弱，讓自己繼續賴床，你就輸了。」[^2]

於是，我決定再也不按下貪睡鍵，無論那天早上我有多疲勞、多麼想繼續睡，我都會立刻起床，因為「我是一個自律的人。」

# 一昧追求「自律」的黑暗面

我一直相信「自律等於自由」，這也是 [我的核心價值](https://huami.ng/dear-today-me/) 之一。每當看到有人過著如苦行僧般的生活：規律的日常作息、簡樸的飲食習慣等，我就會瞬間變成小粉絲，充滿好奇心地向他們請益、學習。

馬拉松之神 [Eliud Kipchoge](https://www.google.com/search?q=Eliud+Kipchoge) 在 [訪問](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hywDs1dhTOI) 中提到：「只有在生活中紀律嚴明的人才是自由的。如果缺乏紀律，只會成為情緒和激情的奴隸。」[^3]

但當我越練習自律，我越發現：**自律只不過是持續做自己熱愛的事情後的結果 — 關鍵不在於自律，而是我真正熱愛什麼事情？**

就像閱讀前哨站的瓦基說的：「[自律只是外在的表面結果，自願才是內在真正的驅動力。](https://www.instagram.com/p/CdLGCVMqSv_/)」

我一直以為，自律仰賴的是背後強大的意志力和強迫。

經過一連串的研究、實驗後，我錯了。

真正能長期持久的自律，源於發自非我不可的使命感（為什麼要做？）與刻在心頭上的身份認同（我是誰？）

# 自律背後的科學

核心在為什麼要做

自由與框架間的平衡

# 早起，是練習自律最棒的第一步

it sets the tone for the rest of the day.

[David Goggins - The Mental Lab - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T_BNI23qbn4)

Remember why you are doing this: You get only one life, **one that is not rewarded for staying in bed, one that does not move forward because you stole an extra five minutes of your life.**

	* If you want more sleep, you need to get to bed earlier, not wake up later.

	* Going back to sleep for a few minutes actually leaves you more tired/lazier/groggier than waking up immediately. Set your alarm and stick to it.

	* You cannot miss out your magical time in the morning. You cannot miss out the only opportunity to win the morning and the entire day.

# daring to be disciplined. Wake up at 5 AM every single day. Loser.

# 兩段文字

* “The Breeze At Dawn” by Rumi

> The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you.
> Don’t go back to sleep.
>
> You must ask for what you really want.
> Don’t go back to sleep.
>
> People are going back and forth across the doorsill
> where the two worlds touch.
>
> The door is round and open.
> Don’t go back to sleep.

* “At Dawn” by Marcus Aurelius

> At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work—as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for— the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?
>
> —But it’s nicer here… .
>
> So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
>
> —But we have to sleep sometime… .
>
> Agreed. But nature set a limit on that—as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you’re still below your quota.
>
> You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they’re really possessed by what they do, they’d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts.
>
> Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?

# Powerful beyond measure

**Quit hitting the snooze button ⏰**

* When you hit snooze, you’re telling your hopes and dreams that they can wait.

練習自我領導力，「嗯，我是一個自律的人。」的身份認同

後來，我改變想法了：我決定好好聆聽內心和身體的聲音。然後繼續按下貪睡鍵。
